*Code Complete* by Steve McConnell (2004) is a classic but immense volume intended for professional developers. It includes a lot of research and evidence-based practice suggestions.

*Code Craft* by Pete Goodliffe (2007) is a 580-page book, intended for serious software developers. It is essential for coders working as part of a development team, working to specifications set by clients. It’s a really well written book, with examples in C, and emphasis on process and security.

*Good Habits for Great Coding* by Michael Steuben (2018) is example-driven, Python based, and is focused on programmers in AI and algorithms. It is also a great read.
